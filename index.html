            <div id="description">
                <p>I am a High School English teacher who graduated at the University of KwaZulu Natal majoring in English and Business Management.</p>
                <p>I have a strong personality and I am quite outspoken. However, it has not always been that way but social media has really helped me gain my confidence because it has shown me that I actually have a lot to say, and there are people who are interested in what I have to say, be it banter, or serious social issues.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I have acquired quite a following on social media, particularly Twitter and the numbers seem to grow every day. This makes me happy because it means more and more people are interested in the content that I put out, and that has helped me get a few online marketing and content creating jobs, which really got me interested in Digital Media and Brand Strategizing, which is my current pursuit.</p>
